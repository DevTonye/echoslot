            <h2>Our Journey</h2>
            <p>
                Echoslot was born when I, Tonye Tobin, grew tired of wasting hours in queues for simple appointments like haircuts. Frustrated by the inefficiency, I decided to build a solution myself.
            </p>
            <p>
                Working solo, I designed, coded, and launched Echoslot from the ground up. What started as a personal project to solve my own scheduling frustrations has grown into a platform that now helps businesses save time and serve their clients better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, Echoslot continues to evolve as I work directly with users to improve features and ensure it remains the simplest, most effective scheduling solution available.
